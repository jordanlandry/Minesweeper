# Minesweeper

This is a remake of the classic game minesweeper, including heavily inspired assets from the original.

## How to play

To play Minesweeper, simply click on any square on the game board to reveal its contents. If the square contains a mine, the game is over. If the
square does not contain a mine, a number will be revealed indicating how many mines are adjacent to that square in a 3x3 grid (including corners). Use
this information to determine which squares are safe to click on.

To flag a square as containing a mine, right-click on the square. This will place a flag on the square, indicating to the player that they believe
there is a mine located there. To remove a flag, right-click on the square again.

The game is won when all non-mine squares are revealed. If the player clicks on a mine, the game is lost.

Click on the smiley man to restart the game at any time.
